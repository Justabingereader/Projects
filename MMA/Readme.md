Technical Summary

Complex multi-router topology demonstrating advanced routing concepts, inter-router communication, and network redundancy.

Key Technologies:

Router-to-router connectivity

Load balancing and failover


Implementation Details:

Configured multiple routers with distinct network segments

Implemented routing protocol selection based on requirements

Established router adjacencies and neighbor relationships

Implemented default routing and route filtering


Business Value:

Scalable architecture supporting growth


Skills Demonstrated:

Multi-protocol routing configuration

Network topology design

Routing protocol selection criteria

Troubleshooting complex routing issues

Configuration Examples:

# Static routing

ip route [destination] [mask] [next-hop]

# Dynamic routing protocol enablement

router [protocol] [process-id/AS-number]

network [network-address]

# Route verification

show ip route

show ip protocols
