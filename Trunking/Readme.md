Technical Summary

Enterprise switch configuration implementing VLAN trunking for inter-switch communication and network segmentation.


Key Technologies:

IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tagging

Trunk port configuration

Inter-VLAN routing

Switch-to-switch connectivity


Implementation Details:

Configured trunk links between multiple switches

Enabled VLAN tag preservation across network infrastructure

Implemented allowed VLAN lists for security

Configured native VLAN for untagged traffic


Network Components:

Core/distribution switches with trunk uplinks

Access layer switches with VLAN assignments

Multiple broadcast domains over single physical links


Business Value:

Reduces cabling requirements through logical segmentation

Enables scalable network growth

Improves security through traffic isolation

Supports departmental network separation


Skills Demonstrated:
