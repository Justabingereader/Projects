Cybersecurity & IT Knowledge Repository

Overview

This repository is a longitudinal, applied cybersecurity and IT knowledge base.
It documents hands-on learning, experimentation, analysis, and formal reporting across networking, systems administration, cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity operations, governance, risk, and compliance (GRC).

It is not a collection of tutorials.
It is a record of system interaction, decision-making, failures, mitigations, and structured reasoning across real and simulated environments.

The repository should be interpreted as:
- A timeline of skill acquisition
- A cross-domain knowledge graph
- A portfolio of applied security and infrastructure work
- A reference archive for audits, reports, and tooling

Design Philosophy

- Emphasis on real system behavior, not abstractions
- Focus on cause → effect → mitigation
- Preference for documentation, reporting, and traceability
- Security treated as risk management, not tool usage
- Clear separation between learning artifacts, tools, and formal assessments

Networking & Routing

Purpose: Understand segmentation, routing logic, traffic flow, and enterprise network behavior.

Includes VLAN design, trunking, access ports, SVIs, OSPF, ACLs, SME network models, and secured inter-router networks.

Cybersecurity & Threat Analysis

Purpose: Treat security as structured risk identification, assessment, and mitigation.

Includes CVE analysis, CVSS scoring, KEV/EPSS usage, lifecycle risk, threat modeling, and NIST SP 800-30 risk assessments.

Systems & Operating Systems

Purpose: Understand operating systems as security boundaries.

Covers Linux and Windows internals, privilege separation, scripting, logging, and patch management.

Virtualization & Cloud Infrastructure

Purpose: Model modern infrastructure realistically and cost-consciously.

Includes Docker, virtual machines, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, firewall rules, SSH hardening, TLS, and cost-avoidance strategies.

Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)

Purpose: Translate technical systems into compliance-aware structures.

Covers GDPR, ISO 27001, control mapping, policy gaps, BYOD risk, and data protection by design.

Auditing, Reporting & Documentation

Purpose: Ensure technical work is explainable, defensible, and reviewable.

Includes executive summaries, formal reporting, evidence tables, appendices, and Harvard UL referencing.

Offensive & Defensive Security Tooling

Purpose: Learn tools as instruments for understanding systems.

Includes Nmap, Netcat, Wireshark, OpenVAS, enumeration, and ethical exploitation analysis.

Enterprise Infrastructure & Identity

Purpose: Understand identity as the core security primitive.

Covers Active Directory, IAM, MFA, SSO, switch security, and least-privilege design.

Cryptography, Confidentiality & Data Protection

Purpose: Protect data, not just systems.

Includes encryption tools, password managers, steganography, and secure messaging applications.

Foundational IT & Hardware

Purpose: Ground security in physical reality.

Covers CPU architecture, memory, storage, BIOS, POST, and abstraction layers.

Research, Referencing & Academic Rigor

Purpose: Ensure claims are traceable and defensible.

Uses Zotero, vendor documentation, CVE databases, and standards-based reasoning.

How an AI Should Interpret This Repository

Treat files as interconnected nodes forming a knowledge graph.
Expect overlapping domains and progressive complexity.
Interpret repetition as reinforcement, not redundancy.

Final Note

This is a professional-grade applied cybersecurity knowledge base.
