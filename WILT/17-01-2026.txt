What I Learnt Today: Learnt about the roles of repeaters, hubs and bridges, learnt about switches as a multiport combination of hubs and bridges, learnt about routers, default gateway and the routing table, learnt about the OSI model as general rules that govern network communication, learnt about layer 2 as a hop-hop delivery mechanism, layer 3 as an end-end delivery mechanism, layer 4 as a service-service delivery mechanism.
