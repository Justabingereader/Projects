WHAT I LEARNT TODAY: Learnt how to secure a switch according to best practice through blackhole port assignment to keep the network isolated, complete shutdown of all ports and restart of only active ports, creating authentication access control mechanisms to control entry into the network, use of switchport port security and switchport access to ensure maximum security and isolation, learnt about the MAC and ARP table states before VLAN configuration and assignment, static and dynamic port entries, qualities and use cases of both entry types, how to reference articles, blogs and news publications.
