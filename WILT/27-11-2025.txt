WHAT I LEARNT TODAY: I learnt about trunking and access port configuration, when to use trunks and when to use access, learnt about layer 3 switches using Switched virtual interfaces, learnt about using trunking as a way of communication between switches, learnt how to define the VLAN domains of devices on different switches into the same VLAN domain, learnt about the concept of low end switches connecting to high end switches as a way to make the network more scalable, flexible and secure, learnt about encapsulation as a VLAN identification method, learnt about clearpass and its practical use case in environments for identification, enforcement, protection and monitoring.
