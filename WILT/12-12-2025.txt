What I Learnt Today: learnt what IT is exactly, learnt the different roles of an IT support staff, learnt about bits, nibbles, bytes and the different numbering systems, learnt about the importance of transistors in the processor of devise, learnt about the process of computer operations, learnt about the various layers of abstraction in software, learnt about electric static discharge, learnt about DDR SDRAM, learnt about the different core components in a computer and laptop and their placement in the devices, learnt about power on self test of BIOS, learnt about serial and VGA connectors, learnt about the userland and kernel subdivisions present in the operating system for abstraction between hardware and applications and their use of APIs to communicate.
