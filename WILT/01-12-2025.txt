What I Learnt Today: Use of CIACD pipeline in android systems, learnt that SDLC can be integrated into GRC, learnt about different SDLC models and their practicalities, learnt about the difficulty of code integration into a main repository from multiple locations, learnt about attenuation and path loss model, learnt about signal to noise ratio, learnt about difference between risk termination and risk avoidance, learnt about the difference between software and application, learnt about user preference, constrained programming and optimisation models on the algorithm of streaming services, learnt about the influence of priority on risk strategy that will be implemented, learnt about various regions that allocate IP addresses, learnt about the difference in the effects of privacy on WHOIS searches among users in different regions, learnt about port address translations, learnt about autonomous system number, learnt about topology and the various types of topologies, learnt about East-West and North-South traffic in networks, learnt about the OSI and TCP/IP models, learnt about the different tools used to regulate inbound and outbound traffic in a network such as firewalls, IDS/IPS systems and load balancers, learnt about network attached storage and its uses in a network, learnt about storage area network and its uses, learnt about wireless access points and its uses in a network, learnt about Wireless LAN Controllers and its role in managing the wireless APs in a network, learnt about content delivery network and its use of point of presence edge servers to get resources to load faster, learnt about hypervisor and virtual private cloud, learnt about the different cloud deployment models, learnt about the different cloud service models, learnt about ports, TCP, and UDP, learnt about IPsec and its role in web security, learnt about the different types of communication in a network, learnt that the Transport layer processes its data as segments, network layer processes its data as packets and data link layer processes its data as frames and is where the headers and trailers come into play.
