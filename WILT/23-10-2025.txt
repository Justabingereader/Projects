WHAT I LEARNT TODAY: How VLANS and Subnets should be an equal amount, learnt how to calculate binary in a subnet, and how address dependency size can be manipulated on need or replacement, learnt how to find the first and last address space on a specific subnet e.g. size of the staff micronetwork depending on requirement, applied subnetting to a CISCO packet tracer WAN architecture to improve segmentation and address space management, learnt about class B private networks and implemented a communicating WAN on cisco packet tracer, tested and reviewed the connection.
