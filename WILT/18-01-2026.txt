What I Learnt Today: Learnt about the encapsulation and de-encapsulation process, learnt about everything hosts that are either directly connected or connected through a router do to communicate on the internet, learnt about the various actions carried out by a switch to send data in a network, learnt about RFC and its role in building the internet, learnt about the multiple ways in which routing tables can be populated, learnt about what happens to a packet when it's received by a router that does not know its destination address, learnt about default routes and route summarization, learnt about the mapping present in MAC address table, ARP table and Routing table and their role in network communication, learnt about cookies and the role of layer 5, 6, and 7 of the OSI model in network communication.
