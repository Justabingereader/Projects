WHAT I LEARNT TODAY: Identifying Vulnerabilities through various CVE databases, identifying end of sale and end of life support status on devices from vendor documentation, blogs and articles, how to write a penetration test report in a methodological and structural manner, identifying various details in a device that can be used to exploit the device, learnt the grouping of various CVSS identifiers based on their category and scores, how to frame practical recommendations for different devices based on their vulnerability and end of sale/end of life support status, how to cite various references such as blogs, documents, articles and webpages using Zotero.
