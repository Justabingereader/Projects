WHAT I LEARNT TODAY: What should be included in an audit, importance of documentation in an audit, the use of threat management and risk management to help in an audit, different categories or sections audited in an organisation, different vulnerability scoring systems such as CVSS, KEV and EPSS. CVSS being the default vulnerability scoring system even though it isn't necessarily the most accurate, learnt about the concept of spanning tree protocol, SSL and TLS as security gateways, the different versions of TLS and what current versions of TLS is being supported, how to use stat.ripe.net, what sections it covers, the concept of QUIC.
