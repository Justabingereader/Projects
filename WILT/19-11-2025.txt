WHAT I LEARNT TODAY: learnt how to use NMAP and netcat to scan and gain remote access to an insecure metasploitable Virtual Machine with a Kali Virtual Machine, learnt how to open a port connection and assess open ports, learnt about banner grabbing and the command to banner grab a particular IP Address and identify underlying OS of the target machine, learnt about the total number of available IP addresses and ports, learnt about the unsecure nature of telnet and the encrypted nature of SSH, learnt about the range of well known ports, learnt about universal plug and play and the vulnerability it creates, learnt about error 404 servers being legitimate targets.
