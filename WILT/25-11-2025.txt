WHAT I LEARNT TODAY: The difference between risk avoidance and risk mitigation, where risk avoidance can and should be applied and where risk mitigation can and should be applied, the feasibility of combining multiple risk treatment strategies to various parts of the risk, the conditions under which combination of risk strategy treatments is logical, how they are documented in a report, I learnt the contradiction of risk acceptance and risk avoidance.
